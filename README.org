#+TITLE: Shuttlemacs
Shuttlemacs is the name I have given my emacs config. It's not meant
to be something like spacemacs or anything. I like and use spacemacs a
lot but wanted to have a faster, less bloated version with only the
things I use. Keep in mind this is nothing like spacemacs but it
inspired me to create my own config.
